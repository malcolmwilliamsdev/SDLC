1) How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To interpret user needs, I engage in active listening and open communication with my clients and stakeholders. This involves gathering requirements, conducting interviews, and possibly     creating   surveys or questionnaires to gain insights. User stories are concise, user-focused descriptions of functionality that capture the who, what, and why of a requirement. They help in   breaking down complex functionalities into manageable bits. By using user stories, I can prioritize features based on their importance and value to the end-users.

2) How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach program development with an Agile mindset. This involves iterative and incremental progress, ensuring that the software evolves in response to changing requirements and feedback. I   value collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement. I plan to incorporate Kanban, an effective tool for visualizing workflow and managing work in progress. It ensures that the team maintains a steady flow of work.

3) What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development involves several key aspects. I believe a good team member is able to efficiently manage time, collaborate, adapt, and communicate.
